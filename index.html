    <h2>Sauti Sol band</h2>
    <p>Sauti Sol are Kenyan afro-pop band formed in Nairobi Kenya by vocalists Bien-Aim√© Baraza, Willis Chimano and Savara Mudigi in 2005.The band has had several successful tours in Africa and Europe, topped Kenyan charts and gained international attention with shows in Europe and the US, as well as television appearances and various accolades and nominations, including their 2011 concert performance in Kenya with South African a cappella group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The band has also received both local and international accolades and nominations, including at the Kisima Music Awards, the Channel O Music Video Awards, the MTV Europe Music Awards, and the BET Awards.
       I love Sauti Sol because their music uplifts low spirits, express feelings of love and offers words of encouragement
